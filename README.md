# contact page Server Side

This is a server page that responds to a post message and displays 

![set client id and secret](README_images/ScreenShotOfOauth2Config.png "set client id and secret")

I put the credentials in a file called creds.json which is in the .gitignore. I made a `creds.sample.json` that you can use for the key values.
